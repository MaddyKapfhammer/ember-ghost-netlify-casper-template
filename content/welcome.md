Hi, my name is Madelyn, Madelyn Kapfhammer to be exact, but my friends call me Maddy. 

I am a first year college student, working very hard to make it through the major of biology and computer science. Welcome to my journey. 


### There are a few things that you should know up-front:

1. Work ethic is very important. Applying oneself is essential to personal and professional success.

1. Make mistakes. It is easier to learn from messing up than doing perfectly the first time around. 

1. Laughter is key. Sometimes it is so necessary to just take time to laugh a little.
