Hi, my name is Madelyn, Madelyn Kapfhammer to be exact, but my friends call me Maddy. 

I am a first year college student, working very hard to make it through the major of biology and computer science. Welcome to my journey. 


### There are a few things that you should know up-front:

1. Work ethic is very important. Applying oneself is essential to personal and professional success.

1. Make mistakes. It is easier to learn from messing up than doing perfectly the first time around. 

1. Laughter is key. Sometimes it is so necessary to just take time to laugh a little.

### About me
Born in Fairfax, Virginia, and raised in Cochranton, Pennsylvania I was (and still am) close to my family.

Being the middle grandchild of seven, my cousins and I were always together, along with my parents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. The summers were spent on my grandparent's back deck jumping in and out of the pool. As the years went on summers turned into marching band practice, and sleeping in army tents as a camp counselor. 

In high school I was a part of Academic Sports League, going to competitions performing speeches, and mock interviews. I was first trumpet of the Cochranton High School Marching band, and participated in chorus for a few years until I learned that I can't sing at all. For middle school and part of high school I was a part of the CHS Student Council general membership until recieving an officer position as a junior, and the presidency my senior year. I loved being a part of yearbook, NHS, and prom committee. I loved being able to make a change in my school and my community, big or small. 

I started studying biology in ninth grade, and found an interest in computer science the same year. I was fascinated with cells and chromosomes and DNA and the internet and binary numbers, and code. Experiences through the rest of my high school career helped me to realize that I truly have a passion for both of these fields.
