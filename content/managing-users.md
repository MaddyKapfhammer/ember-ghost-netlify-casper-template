I'm not going to lie, Google is one of my metaphorical best friends. I use it for a number of things, including searching the best shows on Netflix, finding an outfit to wear to my cousin's wedding, the best Christmas gifts for parents, and also internships. 

###Internships: 
The dreaded word for some students, and the highly anticipated for others. Personally, I think that I am a little mixture of both. 

Among coming home for winter break, my wonderful parents talked to me greatly about how amazing of an opportunity an internship would be, and I wholeheartedly agreed with them, despite being slighly terrified. I looked forward to being able to advance my skill set in the field of computer science, and definitely thought that an internship would be the place to do it. 

###A first year getting an internship? 

Yeah, I thought it was crazy too, but finding an internship can prove to be easier than suspected (at least in the field of computer science). After returning to school from the same winter break where my parents encouraged me to apply for internships, I sat down on my lofted bed with a three inch memory foam matress pad, and typed away on Google. I was searching for any type of paid position or internship where I could offer my abilities. *Technology jobs in (put location here)* and *Paid internships near me* and *Opportunities for computer science students* were all listed as top searches in my Google history. 

Even crazier than thinking that a first year could apply for an internship, was actually finding some. Soon I had a document with a list of a solid five opportunities to apply for. Some, of course, didn't work out and some I am still waiting to hear about. 

###It's not as hard as you think 
Really, I thought that getting an internship would be like hiking up a mountain in flip flops with nothing to cling on to. In reality, you kind of just have to put yourself out there. Of course, develop your skill sets and always stick to learning more about the field that you're interested in, but also just **apply**. 

#####Keep in mind: I still don't have an internship
